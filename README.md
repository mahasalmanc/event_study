# AI Announcements Event Study

This repository contains the data and analysis done for my event study dissertation in two excel files:
chatgpt4o_may13_event_data(new) and chatgpt_launch_event(new).

Firm level modeling is done on separate sheets within each file, with a summary group-level analysis complete on the final sheet.
Multiple sheets may exist for some firms, and will be labelled with (Old) for inactive files. However, were still included in the file to show the initial approach taken to the event study.

The Event 1 vs Event 2 overall comparison  was done in the chatgpt4o_may13_event_data(new) workbook and Firm comparisons across Event 1 and Event 2 for Chegg, BAC, WFC, and Nvidia were done in the chatgpt_launch_event(new) workbook.
These analyses were kept within two workbooks, as opposed to creating new Excel files, to allow tracing of formulas or analyses done.

All formulas are embedded within the files, if further clarification is needed from what was stated in the dissertation. 

The Data Extraction .ipynp file contains the code used to extract the Yahoo finance data used for the analysis. Raw data is presented on the 'All Data' tabs of both Excel files.
