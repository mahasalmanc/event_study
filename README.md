# event_study

This repository contains the data and analysis done for my event study dissertation in two excel files:
chatgpt4o_may13_event_data(new) and chatgpt_launch_event

Firm level modeling is done on separate sheets within each file, with a summary group-level analysis complete on the final sheet.
Multiple sheets may exist for some firms, and will be labelled with (Old) for inactive files. However, were still included in the file to show the initial approach taken to the event study.

Event 1 vs Event 2 comparison overall was done in the chatgpt4o_may13_event_data(new) workbook and Firm comparisons across events were done in the chatgpt_launch_event workbook.
These analyses were kept within two workbooks, as opposed to creating new Excel files, to allow tracing of formulas or analyses done.
